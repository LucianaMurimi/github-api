# github-api
Using the Github API, the three asynchronous JS concepts are illustrated; callbacks, promises and async-await

From the Github API, the user repo data and avatar image were obtained using XMLHTTPRequest.
This was achieved using callbacks(callbacks.js), promises(promises.js) and async/await(asyncAwait.js) separately so as to clearly illustrate the different concepts.

Key Concepts:
- APIs
- Asynchronous JS(callbacks, promises, async/await) vs Synchronous JS
- DOM
- Arrays
