# github-api
Using the Github API, the three asynchronous JS concepts are illustrated; callbacks, promises and async-await

From the Github API, user data was obtained using `XMLHTTPRequest`.
Callbacks(`callbacks.js`), promises(`promises.js`) and async/await(`asyncAwait.js`) were used separately when making the requests so as to clearly illustrate the different concepts.

Key Concepts:
- APIs
- Asynchronous JS(callbacks, promises, async/await) vs Synchronous JS
- DOM
- Arrays
